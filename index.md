## Welcome to (Name)'s GitHub Page!

Here you'll find all the change-logs and development previews for the server.

In this site it'll go into detail on the different items we've added/planning to add.

Most of the scripts that you'll see in on this site aren't owned/created by the developers of the server, however we'd like to show them off, we'll try to add links to the original posts as best we can.

    > We've realised what causes this, this isn't a server sided issue rather than a client sided issue, [read this post to see how to fix it](https://namedeveloper.github.io/-name-website//discordpermsfix.html)
