``` Part 1: CAD ```

The first part of the training will focus on the inner workings of the CAD. Direct all the trainees to our [CAD](https://sonorancad.com/) and make sure that everyone attending is completely logged into the CAD before continuing with the training. Once everyone is fully logged in and can see the CAD we are going to go over all the sections that are important to know as an law enforcement officer. Remember most members are completely new to the CAD and they need to be familiarized with it. Go over the following sub menus.

- Submit feedback;
    - Briefly go over how and why you should submit feedback you can submit (Player and Community)
    - ex. You saw a member clearly violating a policy. <Player
    - You would like to see LEO only ride with blue lights. <Community
- Submit a bud/dev request;
    - Briefly go over why and when you should file a bug or dev request and explain the difference between them.
- LOA request;
    - Make sure the trainees are aware of the 30 day activity requirement and explain them if they are not able to uphold that they could file for an LOA.
- Member commendation form;
    - Make trainees aware they have the ablility to praise other players publicly via the discord.

Important links:
- Briefly point out to the members the links to the LEO SOP, LEO Weapon Structure and LEO Vehicle Structure. Inform them that the easiest way to access them in game is via these links in the cad.

Activity:
- Briefly point out that members can check the last time they played by asking Department Relations.

**LEO Equipment**

*Requirement:*

- Go over what equipment they have in their vehicle and person.
- Outside of their normal loadout they have and go over usage.
    - First Aid Kit
    - Fire Extinguisher
    -    Prybar
    -    Scene Tape
    -    Traffic Cones
    -    Narcotics Test Kit - For field testing samples for positive/negative narcotics results. This is not the mouth swab, you can only put in a small amount of suspected drugs into the vial, shake, then the color it turns (if any) determines the narcotic. If it stays clear it's not a detectable drug.
    -    Carbine Rifle and Shotgun in vehicle rack. (Ride along partners may keep their weapons in the trunk.)
    -    Latex Gloves
    -    Road Flares
    -    Duty Bag containing ticket books, notepads, pens, and reports.
    -    Spike strips.
    -    Plate Carrier - if not worn for duty.
    -    Rain Jacket
    -    High Visibility Vest - for traffic control.
    -    Extra equipment such as batteries, cable ties, tape, and hand sanitizer.
- Only TEU can administer field sobriety tests, this includes the breathalyzer.
    - An at-station breathalyzer can be used by officers if no TEU is on, or a blood draw at a hospital.



**Comms/RTO**

*Requirement:*

- Ensure that RTO is followed at all times
- Ensure they know how to do proper call outs ( Give them scenarios and tell them to do the call out for it.)
    - ex. 1L326 Traffic Postal 9100 Grove St Black 4 Door Sports occupied 1x No additionals needed.
- Do’s and Don'ts of comm traffic
    - No unnecessarily long transmissions, or long pauses.
    - No fluff wording (Unnecessary info, ummm’s, ect.)
    - Keep it Short and to the point with all relevant info.


**Officer Expectations**

*Requirements:*

- They are to be Kind, courteous, and professional at all times.
    - This includes reciting key things such as:
        - Miranda Rights
            - ex. You have the right to remain silent anything you say can be used against you in the court of law you have the right to an attourney if you cannot afford one one will be apointed to you by the state of san andreas, with these rights in mind do you have any questions for me?
        - Anything on you that’s going to poke me, stick me or hurt me?
- Higher expectations from now on, at all times, since they are trained they know better. (Even off duty, act accordingly. Remember you are a Civ off duty not a LEO)
- What they can do (Take pictures, bag/collect certain evidence, get contact info, statements)
- Basic scene contamination protection.
- What they can’t do (Dust and lift prints/run prints, DNA, Interrogations, Breathilyzers, ect.) They can however call for the County to do it for them.
- They can do interviews in the field, and at the station. They can’t offer plea deals, or payments etc. that fall under CIU. They can however bluff to get information.
    - The basic difference here is that an interview is typically a less formal and accusatory conversation whose main point is to elicit information whereas an interrogation is formal and is mainly designed to get a suspect to confess.

- In plain sight investigation/inquiry upon approach, active/passive policing, don’t tunnel vision, etc.
- De Escalation not escalation
    - The force [pyramid](https://i.imgur.com/EBepNJ0.png)
- Know the difference between probable cause vs. reasonable suspicion
- If a person(s) are being arrested for (X) reason, tell them that they are under arrest, what they’re being charged with, read them their rights preferably before putting them in your vehicle. There are circumstances where it's not required. They however, do need to be searched before they are in the back of your vehicle.


**Starting Patrol/Setup**

- Starting Patrol:
    - Arriving at LEO Station already dressed for duty, or creating an off duty version to drive in (on their own time). Link the MP creation video if they don’t know how yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATbl1j9Avg4
    - Once you are in Uniform and/or signed into that CAD you are considered on duty. Since you now represent your respective LEO departments.
    - Talk about RP gathering your equipment.
    - Spawning vehicle (crown Vics only for trainees, any for trainers just keep in mind their limitations).
    - How to set up the CAD/MDT in steam overlay.
    - Setting self in-game, checking BOLOs, AOP, etc.

- IN-game command list, show them how to get to it, and how to navigate it.
- Proper use of Panic Button
    - Dead officers can’t push buttons and K9 can't call for support over Radio!
    - Inform them of /panic and 10-99
    - 10-33 is now priority traffic, go over how to properly use it.
        -Need to give location and identifiers.
- Ending Patrol:
    - Driving to the station, deleting vehicles.
    - Setting self out-of-game / notifying Dispatch or channel
    - IRL Emergency procedures (Let SOMEONE quickly know)

On a moving motorcycle

During your time out on the streets you'll be exposed to a number of factors that might make you use your less-leathal or leathal weapon.
Remember back to the force [pyramid](https://i.imgur.com/EBepNJ0.png) when making these decisions.

- Taser
    - When firing the taser make sure to shout 'Taser Taser' and give them atleast 1 warning.
    - While using the taser make sure that the suspect isn't:
        - Near a ledge (Once tases they can fall off)
        - Jumping or Climbing over Obstacles
        - wet or in water
        - If they've got known medical conditions

        - Shooting the hands is not recommended but is allowed, just remember it WIll break their hands.

Note - Bean Bag Rounds and Tasers are used when a person is a danger to themselves and others but is not a direct threat in a manner that deadly force would be appropriate – typically a suicidal individual with a bladed weapon. They are ***intended*** to disable the person without killing them.


**Advanced Techniques**

- This system allows speed tracking of two vehicles. Strong signals, and fast signals. Strong just means large vehicles like bus’s or trucks, and fast vehicles that are smaller/going faster. So people can’t dodge radar thinking they can whip in and out of large vehicles.
- Num pad 7 locks and unlocks front ant, num pad 4 lock and unlocks rear ant. 
- Num pad 9 to lock and unlock the front reader, and num pad 6 to lock and unlock the rear reader.

- Key lock is “F5”
- SL Sen, OP Sen or Same lane sensitivity, opposite lane sensitivity respectively. Is the range of the radar, 1 shortest: 5 longest.
- Plt Sen is plate sensitivity, or the range at which it reads. 1 shortest: 5 longest.
- Beep is loudness 1 lowest: 5 highest.
- PLt AUd or plate audio, the voice that tells you you are locked into a plate. loudness 1 lowest: 5 highest.
