``` Part 1: CAD ```

The first part of the training will focus on the inner workings of the CAD. Direct all the trainees to our [CAD](https://sonorancad.com/) and make sure that everyone attending is completely logged into the CAD before continuing with the training. Once everyone is fully logged in and can see the CAD we are going to go over all the sections that are important to know as an law enforcement officer. Remember most members are completely new to the CAD and they need to be familiarized with it. Go over the following sub menus.

- Submit feedback;
    - Briefly go over how and why you should submit feedback you can submit (Player and Community)
    - ex. You saw a member clearly violating a policy. <Player
    - You would like to see LEO only ride with blue lights. <Community
- Submit a bud/dev request;
    - Briefly go over why and when you should file a bug or dev request and explain the difference between them.
- LOA request;
    - Make sure the trainees are aware of the 30 day activity requirement and explain them if they are not able to uphold that they could file for an LOA.
- Member commendation form;
    - Make trainees aware they have the ablility to praise other players publicly via the discord.

Important links:
- Briefly point out to the members the links to the LEO SOP, LEO Weapon Structure and LEO Vehicle Structure. Inform them that the easiest way to access them in game is via these links in the cad.
