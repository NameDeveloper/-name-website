###### How To Fix Non Syncing Of FiveM Roles
``` How to Fix: ```

Fistly go into your FiveM Settings in game located in the top right hand corner of your main menu.
Secondly make sure that your discord account identifier and name are correct, it should look something like this `ImBad#1828`. If it doesn't say that it should say Link Discord, while you do this make sure that you are logged into discord on your Discord Client and on your Web Browser. If all else fails please create a ticket on the discord or open a issue on our [github](https://github.com/NameDeveloper/-name-website/issues/new)
